### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Andrey Shevtsov

#### I'm a self-teached programmer from Kazakhstan. Before I've studied in National Research Nuclear University "MEPHI" in Moscow, but unfortunately I had
to leave my studies because of family problems. Right now I'm continuing learning topics related to computer science and programming. My main programming 
language is Java. I'm also using such technologies as Spring Framework, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases. And I happy to say, that I'm still
learning new things. You can also check my projects that I've complited or whir are still in progress.
